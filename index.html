    <h1>What is TOOLSHED?</h1>
    <p>TOOLSHED is a a web&ndash;based company that allows users to rent tools of all kinds, from a simple hammer to a pneumatic jackhammer. It aims to democratize handyman projects by making any tool imaginable available at the click of a button.</p>
    
    <h2>What is Power(ful)?</h2>
    <p>Power(ful) is the custom design system for TOOLSHED. It refers to both the tools, which are sturdy and dependable, and also to the sense of well-being and satisfaction that comes from gaining knowledge and accomplishing a task. Our system gives a visual indication of trustworthiness, equity, and resourcefulness.</p>
    
    <h2>What defines us?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sustainability: sharing resources – both tools and the know-how to use them – reduces waste, saves space and fosters a greater sense of community </li>
        <li>Creativity: affordable access to a wide range of tools expands the creative vision and allows users to create the projects they imagine</li>
        <li>Self-Sufficiency: access to the tools means users don’t have to hire someone else to make repairs</li>
        <li>Empowerment: new tools can be intimidating; the Toolshed website offers guidance, instructions, watch how-to videos  and an online community to ask advice and share experiences</li>
        <li>Accessibility: tools are expensive and cost creates a barrier to undertaking some projects; by sharing resources, we make tools affordable for everyone</li>
    </ul>
